How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
 I spend 40 minutes for testing. 
 If I had more time I would add css to the html and I would write more maintainable and testable code by creating classes and injecting the service into the class constructor so I could mock the service for the testing purpose.
 I could use Angular as well which facilitate coding and test but necessary for such a small example.

What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
  Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
  restaurant += `
        <ul>
        <li>Name: ${restaurants[i].Name}</li>
        <li>Rate: ${restaurants[i].RatingAverage}</li>`

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
 I use different load to find the threshold for my methods.

How would you improve the Just Eat APIs that you just used?
 I would use pagination to lower the load on the server
